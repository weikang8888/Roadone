                        Driving style Be sure to consider your driving style
                        when choosing a tyre. If you travel frequently, consider
                        choosing an economy with the farthest mileage. If your
                        driving style tends to be more athletic, consider
                        turning a higher-grip tyre.

                        Evaluating the performance characteristics of the tyres
                        will help you find a tire that is best suited to your
                        own style.

                        Choose tyre according to vehicle Matching tyre refers to
                        the tire that the factory installs when the vehicle is
                        manufactured. When choosing a matching tyre, the car
                        manufacturer usually chooses a tyre that meets the
                        maximum range of buyer's needs. The owner's manual may
                        provide further recommendations for replacement tires.

                        Usually, matching tires are best for your vehicle, but

                        how long a tyre can be used or how much fuel is saved,
                        dealers can recommend the most cost-effective tyres
                        based on your driving needs and budget.
